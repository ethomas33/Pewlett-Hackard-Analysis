## Summary: 

I suggest that Pewlett Hackard investigate further into the demographics of their employees to help them identify more pattern on how and where gaps will need to be filled. Specifically I would investigate which departments will be hit the hardest as well as the amount each department will be dropping in paid out salary for those retiring to give those departments a better planning tool to begin recruiting more talent for their teams. The other factor to consider in both scale and timeline is the institutional knowledge these retiring employees posses. I encourage the company to work out strategies to capitalize on the knowledge share of this information sooner rather than later to make sure it isn't lost. This can take the form of workflow documentations or better yet to leverage the existing mentorship programs.
